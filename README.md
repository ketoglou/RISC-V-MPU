## Project Description
This project is a RISC-V ISA based microprocessor. The design contains the RV32E and Zicsr 
instruction sets along with some registers from Machine level. Except the basic functions 
this MPU is capable to execute Interrupts-Exceptions with simple requirements. In the 
components folder you will find all of the modules in VHDL, the RISCV_CPU.bdf in the img folder
is the schematic of this MPU and the RISCV_CPU.vhd is the transleted schematic to VHDL. 
At report.pdf in docs folder you can find infrormation about the project.
