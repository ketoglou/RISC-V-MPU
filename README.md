# RISC-V MPU
This project is a RISC-V ISA based microprocessor. The design contains the RV32E and Zicsr instruction sets along with some register from Machine level. Except the basic function this MPU is capable to execute Interrupts-Exceptions with simple requipments. In the Components folder you will find all of the modules in VHDL, the RISCV_CPU.bdf is the shematic of this MPU and the RISCV_CPU.vhd the transleted shematic to VHDL. At Report.pdg you can find infrormation about the project.
