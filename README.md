# RISC-V MPU
This project is a RISC-V ISA based microprocessor. The design contains the RV32E and Zicsr instruction sets along with some registers from Machine level. Except the basic functions this MPU is capable to execute Interrupts-Exceptions with simple requirements. In the Components folder you will find all of the modules in VHDL, the RISCV_CPU.bdf is the schematic of this MPU and the RISCV_CPU.vhd is the transleted schematic to VHDL. At Report.pdf you can find infrormation about the project.
